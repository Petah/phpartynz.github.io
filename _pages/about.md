## Who are we?
We are an open community of developers focused on open source, latest technologies and best practises in software development.
Are you working in PHP? We speak the same language, don't waste your time and [join us](/join/)!

## Where are we?
We are located in New Zealand, mostly Auckland and Wellington. But anyone from all corners of the world is welcome to this group, it's just harder to meet :smile:.

## What do we do?
We mostly discuss the problems we face with each other. Anyone can use our [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/phpartynz) to start a project with other members.

## How do we meet?
There is an open [group on meetup](https://www.meetup.com/phparty/) which everybody can use to organise an event. Otherwise you can hang out on [Slack](https://phparty.slack.com).

## What's in there for you?
More like what's in there for us. We greatly appreciate members who are willing to share their ideas and experience. 
As programmers we need to stay in touch with the latest and most efficient ways to develop software. We need to learn new things on a daily basis.
It's easier with more brains around.
